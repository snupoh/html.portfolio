<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Before the Sunset, by Bruce Willis</h3>
<p>This is because the movie was based on a real life story about the biafran war</p><br/>
<h3>13 Minutes</h3>
<p>This was based on the situation in Bengazi where a US embassy was attacked resulting in the death of the Ambassador under Hilary Clintons as Secretary of State</p><br/>
<h3>London has Fallen, By Gerald Butler</h3>
<p>The action in this movie is crazy and mind blowing</p>
